# FiveDoubles
a program that reads 5 real double numbers and reads them
saves to a table. The program calculates the distance between its successive elements
table and saves it to a new table (you will specify the required size). The distance
results as the absolute value of the difference of the elements (fabs function). For example, if the
the first four elements of the table are: 5.2, -3.2, 7.5, 12.22, the corresponding distances are: | -3.2-5.2 | =
8.4, | 7.5 - (- 3.2) | = 10.7 and | 12.22-7.5 | = 4.72. The program will display at the end the initial table set
entered by the user, in a row as well as the difference table according to the execution that
is presented. Each element of the arrays will be displayed to the nearest 2 decimal places.
